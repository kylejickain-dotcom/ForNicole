    Hey love ðŸ¥¹ðŸ©· I know Iâ€™m late, but happy 1 month of friendship to us.  
    It might sound funny calling it that now, but honestly, thatâ€™s where everything beautiful started â€” with us being friends first.  
    Who wouldâ€™ve thought that from those random talks, late-night chats, and small jokes, weâ€™d end up here, still together, still choosing each other?  
    Itâ€™s crazy, but in the best way possible. ðŸ’—  

    Youâ€™ve been more than just my friend â€” you became my peace, my comfort, my favorite person to talk to after a long day.  
    Every moment with you feels like home. You made me realize that love doesnâ€™t always have to be loud or dramatic,  
    sometimes itâ€™s quiet, soft, and steady â€” like how you make me feel every single day. ðŸ’ž  

    Even after everything, weâ€™re still here, still holding on, still growing together.  
    And that means more to me than words can explain. So, happy one-month-late friendship anniversary, my love.  
    Youâ€™re still my favorite person, my best friend, and the one I want to keep choosing â€” no matter how many months,  
    no matter how late I say it. ðŸ’•
  </p>
